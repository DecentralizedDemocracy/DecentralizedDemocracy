# Decentralized Democracy

This document describes an approach to creating a decentralized version of such systems as fiat currency, banking, taxation, budget allocation and governance. Main characteristics of the decentralized governance are that the people vote on the money supply and its sources, tax and interest rates; the majority voters may be financially liable to the minority voters if public spending defaults; stock market can be extended to small and medium business; and there can exist a procedure for ethical use of personal user data for commercial purposes.

There is a software application that can be potentially created that allows it to spin up an instance of decentralized government whenever one is needed. An individual can then install the app and connect it to as many instances as needed. The instance provides monetary and fiscal systems that make it possible to build institutions that are equivalent to those of the traditional government. The autonomous nature of the instance and the strict set of rules that it sets provide an additional layer of institutional trust.

The traditional democratic system has been designed in the times when our capabilities were extremely limited in comparison to the modern times. By extending the representative mechanism of democracy we can construct a parallel system that adds another layer between the traditional government and the market. In this document we are going to explore the limits that we can take democracy and constitutionalism to with our current technology.
